# Creative Authorship Governance

## AI-Human-First Architecture — Domain Instantiation

---

## Architectural Context

This document instantiates **AI-Human-First Architecture** within the domain of creative authorship.

It demonstrates how artificial intelligence may be integrated into artistic production while preserving:

* explicit human origin,
* non-accumulation of AI authority,
* traceable authorship continuity,
* and fail-closed legitimacy boundaries.

The studio is treated as a bounded governance system in which authorship, responsibility, and legitimacy remain exclusively human.

AI outputs are categorized as **Claims**, never Decisions.
Authority enters only through explicit human authorization.

---

## 1. Foundational Governance Alignment

Creative activity operates under the following architectural invariants:

### 1.1 Non-Accumulation of Authority

AI tools do not gain standing through repetition, familiarity, success, or stylistic influence.
Authority does not accrete through usage.

### 1.2 Human Origin Requirement

Every project must originate in a declared human act prior to any AI interaction.

### 1.3 Fail-Closed Under Ambiguity

If authorship, instruction fidelity, or tool alignment cannot be verified, the work is structurally invalid.

### 1.4 Responsible Agent Principle

A named human assumes full legal and ethical responsibility for all outputs.
AI assistance does not dilute or distribute responsibility.

---

## 2. Structural Governance Devices

Creative work is governed through explicit gate mechanisms designed to prevent silent authority transfer.

### 2.1 Declared-Origin Gate (DOG)

The DOG establishes first-mile human authorship before any AI involvement.

**Requirements:**

* documented human seed (written or recorded),
* declared intent, references, and medium,
* timestamped origin artifact.

**Purpose:**

* prevent blind prompting,
* eliminate ambiguity of origin,
* establish authorship continuity.

Projects initiated without a DOG are structurally invalid.

---

### 2.2 AI-Assisted Work Admissibility Packet (AWAP)

No work may exit the studio without a completed AWAP.

The AWAP includes:

1. Original human seed (DOG)
2. Initial AI instructions
3. Raw AI outputs (Claims)
4. Iterative modification history
5. Audit record
6. Knowledge Pack version hash (SHA-256)
7. Final work artifact
8. Leadership Artifact (explicit human authorization)

**Purpose:**

* ensure traceable authorship,
* prevent authorship gap,
* preserve evidentiary continuity,
* document explicit human judgment at conclusion.

Absent a completed AWAP, work is inadmissible.

---

## 3. Knowledge Pack Integrity

AI tools operate within explicitly defined Knowledge Packs.

Each Knowledge Pack:

* defines permissible references and constraints,
* establishes stylistic and methodological boundaries,
* is cryptographically hashed (SHA-256) to prevent silent modification.

Deviation constitutes structural invalidity.

This mechanism prevents model drift and unauthorized normative expansion.

---

## 4. Functional Role Separation

AI agents may operate in specialized assistive capacities.

AI may:

* surface structural inconsistencies,
* audit compositional logic,
* verify physical plausibility,
* document process traces,
* preserve executional continuity.

AI may not:

* define originality,
* determine authorship,
* assert aesthetic authority,
* redefine legitimacy boundaries,
* authorize final output.

AI produces analysis.
Humans produce judgment.

---

## 5. Phenomenological Documentation Layer

The architecture includes a documentation layer capturing the lived experience of artistic labor.

**Purpose:**

* preserve evidentiary trace of human effort,
* prevent erasure of creative process,
* document interpretive continuity.

This layer records human presence.
It does not generate legitimacy.

---

## 6. Fail-Closed Semantics

The system invalidates work under the following conditions:

* missing declared origin,
* undocumented iteration,
* AI authority substitution,
* knowledge pack drift,
* mid-session alteration of governing principles.

Invalidity halts progression.
There is no retroactive legitimization.

---

## 7. Structural Objective

The objective of this architecture is not acceleration, automation, or efficiency.

It exists to:

* preserve human authorship under AI assistance,
* prevent silent authority transfer,
* maintain legal and ethical defensibility,
* ensure legitimacy remains explicitly attributable.

Creative output remains human-originated and human-authorized.
AI remains assistive and bounded.

---

## Canonical Statement

Creative authorship under AI-Human-First Architecture requires that:

* human origin is explicit,
* AI output remains non-authoritative,
* authority does not accumulate through use,
* legitimacy enters only through human judgment,
* and all authorization is episodic and terminable.

Where these conditions are not met, the work is structurally invalid.
