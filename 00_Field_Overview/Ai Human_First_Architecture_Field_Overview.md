# AI-Human-First Architecture

## Field Overview and Structural Map

---

## 1. Field Definition

AI-Human-First Architecture is a field-level framework designed to preserve **explicit human legitimacy, authority, and responsibility** under conditions of AI acceleration.

The central problem it addresses is not model error, bias, or performance.

The central problem is **silent authority formation**:

* interpretation becoming mandate,
* metrics becoming decisions,
* execution becoming governance,
* repetition becoming legitimacy,
* and AI assistance becoming normative force.

This architecture defines structural constraints that prevent such drift.

---

## 2. Core Architectural Thesis

AI systems may expand analytical and operational capacity.

They may not expand legitimacy.

Authority must remain:

* explicitly human-authored,
* attributable,
* bounded,
* episodic,
* and terminable.

Any system in which authority accumulates implicitly — through speed, familiarity, automation, consensus, or success — is structurally unstable.

---

## 3. Architectural Layers

The field is organized into two primary layers:

### 3.1 Conceptual Framework Layer (Invariants)

This layer defines non-negotiable structural principles.

It includes:

* Human Coherence Principle (GR-C1)
* Leadership as Episodic Legitimacy Intervention
* Non-Accumulation of Authority
* Fail-Closed Under Ambiguity
* Human–AI Role Separation

These principles are domain-neutral.
They do not prescribe policy.
They define conditions of validity.

They answer:

> Under what structural conditions does human legitimacy remain intact in AI-assisted systems?

---

### 3.2 Architectural Instantiation Layer (Domain Applications)

This layer applies the invariants to bounded real-world systems.

Examples include:

* Democratic governance structures
* Creative authorship systems
* Institutional decision environments

Each instantiation must:

1. Explicitly declare human origin.
2. Constrain AI outputs to non-authoritative claims.
3. Prevent authority accumulation through process or time.
4. Define fail-closed conditions.
5. Require explicit human authorization at legitimacy hinge points.

Instantiations demonstrate applicability.
They do not modify the invariants.

---

## 4. Structural Risks the Field Addresses

AI-Human-First Architecture exists to prevent:

* authority-by-momentum,
* decision-by-analysis,
* metric-driven mandate formation,
* algorithmic legitimacy laundering,
* silent delegation of judgment,
* persistence of leadership beyond legitimacy resolution.

These failures often occur after apparent success.
The architecture is designed to hold under pressure, not comfort.

---

## 5. Authority Semantics

Within this field:

* AI produces analysis, summaries, projections, and simulations.
* Humans produce legitimacy judgments and authorization.
* Leadership appears only when legitimacy cannot be presumed.
* Leadership terminates once legitimacy is explicit.

Authority does not emerge from:

* accuracy,
* efficiency,
* institutional adoption,
* or technical sophistication.

Authority enters only through explicit human authorship.

---

## 6. Fail-Closed Logic

When ambiguity threatens legitimacy:

* execution must pause,
* interpretation must not escalate into mandate,
* and human judgment must intervene explicitly or refuse.

There is no automatic progression across legitimacy boundaries.

Systems that optimize around hinge points exit the architecture.

---

## 7. Field Boundaries

AI-Human-First Architecture does not:

* optimize performance,
* recommend policy,
* accelerate workflows,
* replace leadership,
* or automate governance.

It defines constraints.
It does not produce outcomes.

Its role ends precisely where human judgment must begin.

---

## 8. Cross-Domain Consistency Requirement

A valid instantiation in any domain must preserve:

* explicit human origin,
* documented authorization,
* non-accumulation of AI authority,
* reversibility of AI participation,
* and structural invalidation under boundary breach.

If an instantiation weakens these conditions, it exits the field.

---

## 9. Canonical Field Statement

AI-Human-First Architecture preserves legitimacy by ensuring that:

* interpretation never becomes authority by default,
* execution never substitutes for judgment,
* leadership remains episodic and terminating,
* and AI assistance never acquires normative standing.

Where these conditions hold, acceleration remains assistive.
Where they do not, authority leaks.
