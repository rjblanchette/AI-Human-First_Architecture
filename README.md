# AI-Human-First Architecture

*A field-level architecture for preserving human legitimacy under AI acceleration*

---

## Core Thesis

This repository develops a coherent architectural framework for maintaining **explicit human authority, legitimacy, and responsibility** in systems augmented by artificial intelligence.

As AI systems expand analytical and operational capacity, the central risk is not error —
it is the silent formation of authority without explicit human authorship.

This project defines structural constraints that prevent that drift.

---

## Architectural Commitment

The architecture developed here rests on a non-negotiable asymmetry:

* AI may assist interpretation and execution.
* Only humans may bear legitimacy, judgment, and authority.

Authority must be:

* explicit,
* attributable,
* bounded,
* episodic,
* and terminable.

Any system in which authority accumulates implicitly — through metrics, automation, familiarity, or success — is structurally unstable.

## Repository Structure

### Conceptual Frameworks

Field-level invariants and architectural principles, including:

* Human coherence and legitimacy boundaries
* Leadership as episodic legitimacy intervention
* Non-accumulation of authority
* Fail-closed behavior under ambiguity
* Structural human–AI role separation

These documents define the invariant layer of the architecture.

---

### Architectural Documents

Domain-specific instantiations of the architecture applied to real institutional systems.

These documents demonstrate how legitimacy-preserving constraints operate under practical governance conditions.

They do not generalize automatically; they instantiate the architecture in bounded contexts.

---

## What This Repository Is Not

This repository is not:

* a collection of general policy proposals
* a technology advocacy platform
* a performance optimization framework
* a decision-support system

It does not recommend actions.
It defines structural conditions under which action remains legitimate.

---

## Versioning

All documents are maintained under version control to preserve intellectual continuity and structural coherence.

Architectural changes are explicit.
Authority is never implied by iteration.
