# AI-Human-First Architecture

This repository contains research, whitepapers, and architectural work exploring how human authority, coherence, and legitimacy must be preserved under AI acceleration.

All materials are developed through the lens of CSF-2 (Cognitive–Structural Field v2) and related architectural constraints.

## Core Orientation

AI systems materially expand analytical and operational capacity.

This repository examines the structural question:

How must architecture evolve so that AI assistance does not silently become authority?

The work here is not about model capability.
It is about legitimacy, responsibility, and structural boundaries in AI-augmented systems.

## Scope of Work

Materials may include:

- Field-level architectural frameworks
- Governance constraint models
- Boundary definitions
- Legitimacy-preserving system designs
- Whitepapers on AI–human partnership
- Research on authority under acceleration

Documents may be:
- formally published papers
- structured whitepapers
- evolving working drafts
- conceptual explorations

Each document indicates its status where relevant.

## Architectural Commitment

The unifying principle across all work in this repository:

AI may assist interpretation.
Authority remains explicitly human.

Architectures that collapse this distinction are structurally unstable.

## Versioning

All documents are maintained under version control.

Revision history is preserved to maintain intellectual continuity and transparency.
