# Public-Law Institutional Legibility Architecture:
## A Human-Centered Assistive Architecture for Layered Public-Law Governance

---

## Architectural Anchoring

This document instantiates an AI–Human-First architectural approach within the domain of public-law institutional governance. It demonstrates how assistive systems may enhance structural legibility without acquiring normative standing, decision authority, or institutional power. The architecture is a containment instantiation rather than a governance innovation.

## Abstract

Municipal governance in Switzerland operates within a dense and layered legal order characterized by collegial executive authority, separation of powers, and formal procedural obligations. In such environments, institutional coherence depends not only on compliance but on the visibility of structural constraints across mandates, competences, and documentation.

This paper presents a human-centered assistive architecture designed to enhance institutional legibility in Swiss municipal governance. The system does not automate decisions, provide legal advice, or optimize outcomes. Instead, it produces explicit, traceable artifacts that render structural relationships visible while preserving full human sovereignty over meaning, legitimacy, and authority.

The paper formalizes the architecture’s scope, exclusions, structural safeguards, and descriptive analytic mechanisms. It argues that assistive systems in public-law contexts must prioritize containment and human primacy over computational expansion.

## 1. Institutional Context: Layered Public-Law Governance (Swiss Instantiation)

Layered public-law systems operate within multi-tiered legal frameworks. The Swiss context serves here as an initial instantiation of such layering. In Switzerland, municipalities operate within a tripartite legal framework:

- Federal law  
- Cantonal law  
- Municipal regulation  

Executive authority is typically exercised collegially, while legislative bodies provide oversight. Administrative services function under public law and are subject to formal record-keeping and procedural discipline.

Structural characteristics include:

- Collective executive responsibility  
- Legal primacy of higher-order norms  
- Political plurality  
- Formal documentation obligations  
- Mandate-based distribution of competences  

In this environment, institutional friction often emerges not from disagreement but from opacity: unclear mandate boundaries, layered constraints, and fragmented documentation. The central challenge is not decision capacity but structural legibility.

---

## 2. Conceptual Orientation

The assistive system described here is not a governance mechanism. It is an instrument of institutional clarification.

Its function is strictly limited to:

- Rendering constraints explicit  
- Structuring reasoning without directing it  
- Making institutional states traceable over time  
- Preserving human decisional sovereignty  

It neither authorizes nor evaluates.

All meaning-making authority remains with legally designated human actors.

---

## 3. Explicit Exclusions

The architecture is defined by hard boundaries. It is not:

- A decision-making engine  
- A legal advisor  
- A governance authority  
- A political strategist  
- An optimization or scoring system  
- An evaluative performance tool  

It does not:

- Approve or reject actions  
- Rank priorities  
- Judge individuals  
- Issue prescriptions  
- Interpret law  

Its outputs are artifacts only.

No predictive scoring, prioritization, recommendation, or inferential decision layer is permitted under this architecture.

This negative definition is a structural safeguard against authority drift.

---

## 4. Human Primacy and Structural Containment

The system is built around one non-negotiable principle:

**Humans define coherence.**

Institutional legitimacy arises from legally constituted actors operating within public-law frameworks. Computational systems may assist in clarification but never occupy a decisional role.

Structural containment mechanisms ensure:

- All coordination occurs through explicit artifacts  
- Ambiguity halts progression rather than being inferred  
- Only declared public or legal documents inform outputs  
- Architectural evolution occurs only through explicit baseline revision  

These constraints prevent gradual displacement of institutional authority.

## 5. Functional Structure (Without Delegated Authority)

The assistive suite includes bounded instruments that support different aspects of institutional work.

### 5.1 Structural Framing Instrument

Clarifies mandate boundaries and prevents scope drift across executive, legislative, and administrative domains. It routes issues structurally but does not resolve them.

### 5.2 Reflective Structuring Instrument

Makes reasoning visible by:

- Identifying assumptions  
- Surfacing competing interpretations  
- Preserving plurality without arbitration  

It structures thought but never selects outcomes.

### 5.3 Mandate and Competence Framing Instrument

Clarifies whether a matter falls within:

- Municipal competence  
- Cantonal competence  
- Administrative jurisdiction  

It frames institutional location without interpreting legality.

### 5.4 Institutional Communication Instrument

Produces structured drafts for official communication under institutional constraints. It does not generate political strategy or campaign content.

### 5.5 Trace and Documentation Instrument

Supports formal record-keeping by generating:

- Structured meeting summaries  
- Non-attributive trace artifacts  
- Continuity documentation across institutional states  

It does not evaluate participants or decisions.

---

## 6. Descriptive Analytic Mechanisms

The architecture includes descriptive modules designed solely to increase visibility.

### 6.1 Institutional State Reader

Examines a single institutional configuration to assess:

- Mandate alignment  
- Structural consistency  
- Artifact completeness  

It does not assess success, performance, or quality.

### 6.2 Structural Change Descriptor

Compares two institutional states and identifies structural differences. It describes change without narrating progress or decline.

Both mechanisms are diagnostic rather than normative.

## 7. Governance-Theoretic Implications

The dominant paradigm in digital governance emphasizes optimization, prediction, and automation. In contrast, the architecture presented here prioritizes:

- Legibility over efficiency  
- Containment over expansion  
- Human sovereignty over computational inference  

In collegial public-law systems, legitimacy arises from structured deliberation among authorized actors. Assistive technologies must therefore preserve plurality and authority asymmetry rather than collapse them into algorithmic centralization.

The system demonstrates that AI can operate within public institutions without becoming a de facto governance layer.

---

## 8. Authority Statement

All authority, legitimacy, and responsibility remain with legally designated human institutions operating under applicable public law.

Authority enters the system only through formally constituted human acts performed under recognized legal mandate. Artifacts generated by the architecture possess no standing unless explicitly adopted through lawful human procedure.

The architecture is an instrument of legibility.

It holds no power.

It produces no decisions.

It makes structure visible so that humans may decide.
