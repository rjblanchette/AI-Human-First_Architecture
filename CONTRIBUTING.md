# Contributing to AI–Human-First Architecture

## Purpose

This repository defines a constitutional architecture governing AI–human legitimacy separation.

It is not an open idea forum.
It is not a policy debate platform.
It is not a collaborative drafting space for evolving principles.

Contributions are evaluated solely for structural alignment with the regime.

---

## Constitutional Constraint

The following layers are non-negotiable:

* Core Invariants
* Non-Accumulation of Authority
* Human–AI Role Separation
* Leadership Artifact Exclusivity
* Prohibition on Authority by Measurement or Adoption

Proposals that weaken, bypass, reinterpret, or indirectly dilute these invariants will not be accepted.

---

## Scope of Acceptable Contributions

Contributions may:

* Clarify existing architectural definitions
* Improve structural precision
* Correct internal inconsistencies
* Add domain instantiations that strictly comply with the Core Invariants
* Improve documentation clarity without altering regime semantics

Contributions may not:

* Introduce optimization or recommendation layers
* Create authority through metrics or performance
* Introduce renewal defaults or standing mandates
* Convert descriptive measurement into normative inference
* Add new authority pathways

---

## Amendment Discipline

Changes to Core Invariants are treated as constitutional amendments.

Such proposals must:

* Explicitly identify the invariant affected
* Justify structural necessity
* Demonstrate that no alternative layer can absorb the issue
* Preserve Non-Accumulation of Authority

Amendments are rare.

---

## Tone and Structure

All contributions must remain:

* Non-promotional
* Non-advocacy
* Non-comparative across regimes
* Structurally precise
* Neutral in posture

This repository defines legitimacy architecture.
It does not campaign for adoption.

---

## Authority and Attribution

All authority within this repository remains human-authored and attributable.

AI-assisted drafting is permitted, but AI does not confer authorship, authority, or mandate.

---

## Final Note

This architecture defines the conditions under which AI remains human-first.

If a proposal requires relaxing those conditions, it belongs outside this regime.

If you would like, I can also create a **one-page Regime Boundary Notice** that you can pin in Issues to prevent drift early.
